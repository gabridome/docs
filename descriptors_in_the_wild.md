# Descriptors in the wild

I have tried to setup a 2 of 2 multi signature infrastructure with two 
different wallets, which know nothing about each other, but are compliant with 
two very important protocols: [Output Descriptors] and [Partially Signed Bitcoin 
Transactions][PSBT].

Before these two protocols came into existence, making a multi signature setup 
and use it was possible only if the involved parties used the same wallet 
(eg. Electrum Desktop Wallet). This was due 

* to the necessary agreement among the parties on the particular type of 
script to use
* to the way the signatures enriched the transaction until the desired threshold 
to make it valid and spendable.

[Output Descriptors] are a way to express which kind scriptPubKey to produce with
a key or a serie of keys and also which kind of address.
In a more practical way, they dictate how to use keys in a wallet and they can 
be very important when you restore a wallet it could allow you to use it in the same way it was used before or in setting up a multi signature infrastructure.

[PSBT], described in BIP 174, is instead the standard encoding and protocol used to 
create and enrich a transaction with the necessary signatures and other components to make it valid and complete.

Together they provide a common ground to create and use multi signature 
in a eterogeneous environment and this is what I have put to test.

Imagine Alice and Bob owning a company and willing to put the corporate cash in a 
2of2 multi signature setup, so that each one of them have to agree and sign every 
transaction.

Before [PSBT] they should have adopted the same software (e.g. [Electrum]) to do 
the setup, to prepare the partially signed bitcoin transaction to be passed 
to the other party and to add inside the signature of the parties to complete it.

With [PSBT] the partially signed transaction can be enriched step by step 
and passed along **to any wallet aware of this standard** so that Alice and Bob 
are not required to use the same software anymore, as long as they adopt a 
software compatible with [BIP174] (which discipline the use of PSBT).

There's a missing piece though that is the different wallets must know exactly 
which kind of Output script to prepare to be compliant with the other wallets 
taking part in the multisig setup. 

Here is where the [Output Descriptors] come into play. They describe:

* the keys they will use and the sequence
* the type of script the wallet will prepare with that keys and so the type
of addresses the will produce.

By sharing the same Descriptor, every compliant wallet will derive 
deterministically the same multisig addresses.

Immagine Alice using Bitcoin Core (from now on ["Core"][Bitcoin Core]) as a Wallet and Bob who is using a "Last generation" wallet, Bitcoin 
Development Kit (from now on ["BDK"][BDK]), which uses descriptors and miniscript natively.

Each of these software wallet should be able to:

* Create a new address whose transactions are seen by both software as part of the wallet "in common" and which can be given to receive the funds which will be spent only with the consent of both parties
* Express the consent of each party by partially sign the transaction in a way the other wallet can understand and complete it with theyr own signature.

Descriptors PSBT give this possibility to each of the two software. 
With descriptors the two software will be able to produce a very long list of addresses that they can manage, also spending the funds encumbered in the associated 
UTXOs. 

The infrastructure of multiple Extended keys combined toghether to produce multiple 
multisignature wallet is often referred as *[Hyerarchical Deterministic][HDWallet] multi signature wallet or HDM*. 

In this post all the necessary steps to create the HDM usable both in Core and in BDK are illustrated to serve as a guide and as an example to build your own and to play with it (in testnet).

*Note: In Core, [Descriptor wallets] are still experimental and in general, both wallets should be tested for descriptor capabilities in testnet.*

We will build a 2of2 key set up that will be used cooperatively by Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Development Kit.
We need:
* [Bitcoin Dev Kit][BDK]
* [Bitcoin Core] (at the present moment it is necessary to build one the last 
commits on the main branch)
* [Pycoin ku utility][pycoin]

1. We build an Extended Private Master Key for both wallet and derive a BIP84 Extended Master Public.

```
# new Extended wallet data
export core_key=$(ku -n XTN -j create)
echo $core_key

# New Extended Master Private

export core_xprv=$(echo $core_key|jq -r '.wallet_key')

# Derived Extended Pubblic key

export core_xpub_84=$(ku -j -s 84H/0H/0H $core_xprv |jq -r '.public_version')
export core_fingerprint=$(echo $core_key|jq -r '.fingerprint')
echo $core_fingerprint

# Now I build the Extended public key to be communicated to BDK wallet's owner.

export core_xpub_84_for_rec_desc="[$core_fingerprint/84'/0'/0']$core_xpub_84/0/*"
export core_xpub_84_for_chg_desc="[$core_fingerprint/84'/0'/0']$core_xpub_84/1/*"

```

In BDK we do the same:

```
# new Extended wallet data

export BDK_key=$(ku -n XTN -j create)

# New Extended Master Private

export BDK_xprv=$(echo $BDK_key|jq -r '.wallet_key')

# Derived Extended Pubblic key

export BDK_xpub_84=$(ku -j -s 84H/0H/0H $BDK_xprv |jq -r '.public_version')
export BDK_fingerprint=$(echo $BDK_key|jq -r '.fingerprint')

# Now I build the xpub to be communicated.

export BDK_xpub_84_for_rec_desc="[$BDK_fingerprint/84'/0'/0']$BDK_xpub_84/0/*"
export BDK_xpub_84_for_chg_desc="[$BDK_fingerprint/84'/0'/0']$BDK_xpub_84/1/*"

```

## We exchange the BIP84 Extended Master Public and we build a descriptor for each wallet:

To build a multisig wallet, each wallet owner must compose the descriptor adding:
* his derived extended private key AND 
* all the extended public key of the other wallets involved in the multi signature set up 
and composing a newly created multi signature output descriptor with them.

### Bitcoin Core

In our case, the multi signature descriptor for Bitcoin Core will be composed with:

* The BIP84 derived xpub from Bitcoin Development Kit
* The BIP84 derived xprv from Core. 

BDK wallet's owner will send to Core's owner the derived xpub for this purpose.
This how the Core's multisig descriptor will be created and put into an environment 
variable.

```
export core_rec_desc="wsh(multi(2,$BDK_xpub_84_for_rec_desc,$core_xprv/84'/0'/0'/0/*))"
```

Where of course `$BDK_xpub_84_for_rec_desc`is the derived master public created in BDK and received by Core's owner.
the meaning of what is before and after is illustrated in the doc that explain 
the use of [Output Descriptors in Bitcoin Core][Output Descriptors].

We add the necessary checksum using the specific `bitcoin-cli` call.

```
export core_rec_desc_chksum=$core_rec_desc#$(bitcoin-cli -testnet getdescriptorinfo $core_rec_desc|jq -r '.checksum')
```

We repeat the same to build the descriptor to receive the change.

```
export core_chg_desc="wsh(multi(2,$BDK_xpub_84_for_chg_desc,$core_xprv/84'/0'/0'/1/*))"
export core_chg_desc_chksum=$core_chg_desc#$(bitcoin-cli -testnet getdescriptorinfo $core_chg_desc|jq -r '.checksum')
```

### BDK

For BDK we set the derivation for receiving addresses and change addresses in the command line (maybe setting an alias)

Building the descriptor:

```
export BDK_rec_desc="wsh(multi(2,$BDK_xprv/84'/0'/0'/0/*,$core_xpub_84_for_rec_desc))"`
```

Please note that the order of the extended key in the descriptor MUST be the same in the 2 wallets.
We have chosen to put BDK first and in any multisignature wallet, the public key 
derived from BDK will always come first. In alternative, we could have chosen to 
produce the descriptor, [chosing a `soretedmulti` multisignature setup][sortedmulti].

```
export BDK_rec_desc_chksum=$BDK_rec_desc#$(bitcoin-cli -testnet getdescriptorinfo $BDK_rec_desc|jq -r '.checksum')
export BDK_chg_desc="wsh(multi(2,$BDK_xprv/84'/0'/0'/1/*,$core_xpub_84_for_chg_desc))"
export BDK_chg_desc_chksum=$BDK_chg_desc#$(bitcoin-cli -testnet getdescriptorinfo $BDK_chg_desc|jq -r '.checksum')
```

To take a look at the variables:
```
env |grep core_
env |grep BDK_
```

## Creating the multisig wallet and obtaining our first address

Now we are ready to create an experimental empty Descriptor Wallet and to import the descriptors created for this wallet. We will do this both in Core and in BDK.

### Bitcoin Core

```
bitcoin-cli -testnet createwallet "multisig2of2withBDK" false true "" false true false
bitcoin-cli -testnet -rpcwallet=multisig2of2withBDK importdescriptors "[{\"desc\":\"$core_rec_desc_chksum\",\"timestamp\":\"now\",\"active\":true,\"internal\":false},{\"desc\":\"$core_chg_desc_chksum\",\"timestamp\":\"now\",\"active\":true,\"internal\":true}]"
export first_address=$(bitcoin-cli -testnet -rpcwallet=multisig2of2withBDK getnewaddress)
echo $first_address
```

### BDK

Now we use BDK to get the first multisig address:

```
repl -d "$BDK_rec_desc_chksum" -c "$BDK_chg_desc_chksum" -n testnet -w $BDK_fingerprint get_new_address`
```

Et voil√†: the newly created address in Core is the same of the newly created address in BDK. this is part of the miracle of descriptors' interoperability.

## We ask for testnet coins giving the first created address.

To find testnet coins for free you can just google "testnet faucet" and you should 
find some satoshi to play. Just give to the site your first generated address and, 
in twenty minutes, you will find the satoshis in your balance both in Core and in 
BDK.

```
# to check it in Core:

bitcoin-cli -testnet -rpcwallet=multisig2of2withBDK getbalance

# In BDK

repl -d "$BDK_rec_desc_chksum" -c "$BDK_chg_desc_chksum" -n testnet -w $BDK_fingerprint get_balance

```
Some testnet faucets have an address to send back the unused satoshi after having tested your application. Take note of that because we will use it in the next step

## we send part of our balance back to the faucet

```
export psbt=$(bitcoin-cli -testnet -rpcwallet=multisig2of2withBDK walletcreatefundedpsbt "[]" "[{\"tb1qrcesfj9f2d7x40xs6ztnlrcgxhh6vsw8658hjdhdy6qgkf6nfrds9rp79a\":0.000012}]"|jq -r '.psbt')

```

Exactly. We have processed the transaction with Core but we miss in the wallet one of the 
necessary key of the multisig 2of2 setup. The one contained inside BDK.

`tb1qrcesfj9f2d7x40xs6ztnlrcgxhh6vsw8658hjdhdy6qgkf6nfrds9rp79a` is the address 
we got from the faucet site to return the satoshis.

The psbt is sent over to the BDK wallet owner who tries to sign the transaction.

## Conclusion

We have built an HDM and we have used it with two indipendent wallets which are compatible 
with [BIP 174][PSBT] and [Output Descriptors]. Hopefully we will see many other compatible 
wallets beyound [Bitcoin Core] and [BDK], with which we will be able to easily set up 
multi signature schemes.
